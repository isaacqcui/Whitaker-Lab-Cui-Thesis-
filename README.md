MATLAB and videos from Isaac Cui's Thesis (2020)

Core functionality for tracking moving objects from a video and analyzing ballistic parameters are in GetTracks.m and BatchAnalysisGlobal.m.

Three-dimensional tracking from two videos is in threeDimModel.mlx.

Videos overlaying tracks on top of the original video can be made by trackedVideo.m. An example using A_3.mov is provided as trackedVideotest.mp4. 

Blurred videos can be made with smoothMatrix.m and writeVideo.m.
